PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

	OpenSONAR is a command-line-only (for now) program designed to
	aid instructors in running submarine combat simulations.  It was
	designed for, and tested in, the classroom environment.  The intent
	is to provide instructors with the ability to easily manage many 
	contacts with a high degree of accuracy.  The program was designed
	specifically for a geoplot exercise in a NASC201 Naval Weapon
	Systems class.  The instructor was able to easily manage over 15 
	contacts while administering the simulation.

	The aforementioned events and persons were either staff or students
	in the Navy Reserve Officer Straining Corps unit at the University
	of Virginia.  
	
	If you are interested in extending the functionality of the program,
	the source is bundled in the .jar file.  If you have any questions,
	you may reach me at the above e-mail address.
	
HOW TO RUN OpenSONAR
	
	If you're using Windows, and you have Java installed, you should 
	only have to double click the 'OpenSONAR_v.X.jar' file. Note that
	when you exit the program, a file named 'library.jcl' is created
	in the same directory the program resides. This file is required
	to be in the same directory as the program if you want to keep
	your progress saved each time you run the program.
	
	NOTE TO LINUX USERS
	
	To start JWolf Pack in Linux, you open a terminal or console and 
	change to the directory where you saved the .jar file.  You then
	issue the command 'java -jar OpenSONAR_vX.jar' to start the 
	program.  Alternatively, you can right click the .jar and open
	with another program, selecting Java.  IF YOU DO THIS, your 
	library.jcl file will be saved in your home directory /home/user

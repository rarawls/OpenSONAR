# OpenSONAR
Simple command-line simulator for time motion analysis (sub hunting)

OpenSONAR is a command-line-only program designed to
aid instructors in running submarine combat simulations.  It was
designed for, and tested in, the classroom environment.  The intent
is to provide instructors with the ability to easily manage many 
contacts with a high degree of accuracy.  The program was designed
specifically for a geoplot exercise in a NASC201 Naval Weapon
Systems class.  The instructor was able to easily manage over 15 
contacts while administering the simulation.

The aforementioned events and persons were either staff or students
in the Navy Reserve Officer Straining Corps unit at the University
of Virginia.

If you are interested in extending the functionality of the program,
the source is bundled in the .jar file.  If you have any questions,

HOW TO RUN OpenSONAR
	
If you're using Windows, and you have Java installed, you should 
only have to double click the 'OpenSONAR_v.X.jar' file. Note that
when you exit the program, a file named 'library.jcl' is created
in the same directory the program resides. This file is required
to be in the same directory as the program if you want to keep
your progress saved each time you run the program.

NOTE TO LINUX USERS

To start OpenSONAR in Linux, you open a terminal or console and 
change to the directory where you saved the .jar file.  You then
issue the command 'java -jar OpenSONAR_vX.jar' to start the 
program.  Alternatively, you can right click the .jar and open
with another program, selecting Java.  IF YOU DO THIS, your 
library.jcl file will be saved in your home directory /home/user

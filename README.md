# OpenSONAR #
Simple command-line simulator for time motion analysis (sub hunting)

## Why? ##
OpenSONAR is a command-line-only program designed to
aid instructors in running submarine combat simulations.  It was
designed for, and tested in, the classroom environment.  The intent
is to provide instructors with the ability to easily manage many 
contacts with a high degree of accuracy.  The program was designed
specifically for a geoplot exercise in a NASC201 Naval Weapon
Systems class.  The instructor was able to easily manage over 15 
contacts while administering the simulation.

The aforementioned events and persons were either staff or students
in the Navy Reserve Officer Straining Corps unit at the University
of Virginia.

If you are interested in extending the functionality of the program,
the source is bundled in the .jar file.  If you have any questions,
